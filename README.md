# Detection-and-Classification-of-Common-Diseases-Found-in-The-Tomato-Leaf

Here we are using convolutional neural network for the detection and classification of common diseases found in the tomato leaf. Mainly we are classifying the diseases into 10 categories.
1)	Tomato Bacterial spot
2)	Tomato Early blight
3)	Tomato Late blight
4)	Tomato Leaf Mold 
5)	Tomato Septoria leaf spot
6)	Tomato Spider mites Two spotted spider mite
7)	Tomato Target Spot
8)	Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
9)	Tomato mosaic virus
10)	Tomato healthy

The Idea about this project and the basic code are inspired from the YouTube channel codebasics. The data required for the training testing and validation are taken from Kaggle online platform.
